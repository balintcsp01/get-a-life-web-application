# 🎯 Get a Life

**Get a Life** is a community-driven web application that helps people discover hobbies, reconnect with themselves, and find others to try new activities with.

Many people struggle with free time—not because they lack it, but because they don’t know *how* they want to spend it. Others are endlessly curious and want to try everything, but don’t know where to start.  
Get a Life exists for both.

- Get inspired through visuals and community tips

This platform is not just about killing time — it’s about **building a life you enjoy**.
